# A/B Study Plan – Predicting Energy Consumption in Low Energy Houses  

## 1. Executive Summary  
This document outlines an A/B testing framework to evaluate the commercial applicability of machine learning models developed to predict energy consumption in low-energy houses. The goal is to determine whether ML-driven forecasting provides measurable improvements in energy efficiency, cost savings, and comfort compared to traditional approaches.

## 2. Objectives  
- Validate whether the ML-based prediction system outperforms baseline methods.  
- Quantify benefits in terms of energy savings, accuracy, and resident comfort.  
- Provide decision-making insights for scaling and commercial deployment.

## 3. Experiment Design  

### 3.1 Groups  
- **Group A (Control):** Houses monitored with standard/manual energy forecasting methods (baseline).  
- **Group B (Treatment):** Houses monitored with the ML-based predictive model developed in this project.  

### 3.2 Sample Size  
- Minimum of 30 households per group (to ensure statistical significance).  
- Randomized assignment to reduce bias.  

### 3.3 Duration  
- At least 2–3 months to capture varying weather conditions and occupancy patterns.

## 4. Metrics for Evaluation  

- **Prediction Accuracy:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  
- **Energy Savings:** Percentage reduction in total energy consumption.  
- **Cost Impact:** Difference in utility bills between control and treatment groups.  
- **Resident Comfort:** Consistency of indoor temperature within desired ranges.  

---

## 5. Data Collection  
- Smart meters and IoT devices installed in all participating households.  
- Environmental and occupancy data logged (temperature, humidity, appliance usage).  
- Data securely stored and anonymized for analysis.  

---

## 6. Analysis Plan  
1. Perform statistical comparison of metrics between Group A and Group B.  
2. Use t-tests/ANOVA to validate significance of observed differences.  
3. Conduct feature importance analysis to highlight key drivers of energy efficiency.  

---

## 7. Expected Outcomes  
- Improved forecasting accuracy in Group B (ML model).  
- Demonstrable energy and cost savings in the treatment group.  
- Evidence to support scaling the ML solution to a commercial deployment.  

---

## 8. Limitations & Considerations  
- Seasonal variation may impact results if testing period is short.  
- Initial setup costs (smart meters, sensors) must be considered.  
- Resident behavior could introduce variability beyond model control.  

---

## 9. Conclusion  
This A/B study framework provides a structured method to evaluate the real-world performance of ML-driven energy consumption prediction. While actual experimental data is not included here, the framework demonstrates how the models could be validated in a commercial setting.
